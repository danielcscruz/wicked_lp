                        Good news! She's dead<br> 
                        The Witch of the West is dead<br> 
                        The wickedest witch there ever was<br> 
                        The enemy of all of us here in Oz is dead<br> 
                        Good news! Good news!<br> 
                        Look, it's Glinda<br> 
                        Let us be glad<br> 
                        Let us be grateful<br> 
                        Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue<br> 
                        The wicked workings of you-know-who<br> 
                        Isn't it nice to know that good will conquer evil?<br> 
                        The truth we all believe'll by and by<br> 
                        Outlive a lie<br> 
                        For you and-<br> 
                        No one mourns the wicked<br> 
                        No one cries they won't return<br> 
                        No one lays a lily on their grave<br> 
                        The good man scorns the wicked<br> 
                        Through their lives, our children learn<br> 
                        What we miss when we misbehave<br> 
                        And goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely<br> 
                        Goodness knows the wicked die alone<br> 
                        It just shows when you're wicked, you're left only<br> 
                        On your own<br> 
                        Yes, goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely<br> 
                        Goodness knows the wicked cry alone<br> 
                        Nothing grows for the wicked, they reap only<br> 
                        What they've sown<br> 
                        Miss Glinda, why does wickedness happen?<br> 
                        That's a good question<br> 
                        Are people born wicked, or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?<br> 
                        After all, the Wicked Witch had a childhood<br> 
                        She had a father who, by the way, had been appointed governor of Munchkin land<br> 
                        "I'm off to the assembly, dear"<br> 
                        And she had a mother, as so many do<br> 
                        How I hate to go and leave you lonely<br> 
                        That's alright, it's only just one night<br> 
                        But know that you're here in my heart while I'm out of your sight<br> 
                        And like every family, they had their secrets<br> 
                        Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty<br> 
                        I've got one more night left here in town<br> 
                        So have another drink of green elixir<br> 
                        And we'll have ourselves a little mixer<br> 
                        Have another little swallow, little lady, and follow me down<br> 
                        And one thing led to another, as it so often does (no!)<br> 
                        But from the moment the witch was born, she was, well, different<br> 
                        "It's coming" "Now?"<br> 
                        "The baby's coming" "Oh, and how!"<br> 
                        "I see a nose"<br> 
                        "I see a curl"<br> 
                        "It's a healthy, perfect, lovely little- (oh)<br> 
                        Oh, sweet Oz, oh"<br> 
                        "How can it be?" "What does it mean?"<br> 
                        "It's uncanny" "It's obscene!"<br> 
                        "Like a froggy, ferny cabbage<br> 
                        The baby is unnaturally green"<br> 
                        "Take it away, take it away!"<br> 
                        And so, it couldn't have been easy<br> 
                        No one mourns the wicked<br> 
                        Now at last, she's dead and gone<br> 
                        Now at last, there's joy throughout the land<br> 
                        And goodness knows (goodness knows)<br> 
                        We know what goodness is (oh)<br> 
                        Goodness knows the wicked die alone (she died alone)<br> 
                        Woe to those (woe to those)<br> 
                        Who spurn what goodnesses they are shown<br> 
                        No one mourns the wicked (good news!)<br> 
                        No one mourns the wicked (good news!)<br> 
                        No one mourns the wicked!<br>

                        I'll write at once to the Wizard<br> 
                        Tell him of you in advance<br> 
                        With a talent like yours, dear, there is<br> 
                        A definish chance<br> 
                        If you work as you should<br> 
                        You'll be making good<br> 
                        
                        [MADAME MORRIBLE, spoken]<br> 
                        Welcome to Shiz!<br> 
                        <br> 
                        [ELPHABA]<br> 
                        Did that really just happen?<br> 
                        Have I actually understood?<br> 
                        This weird quirk I've tried to suppress or hide<br> 
                        Is a talent that could help me meet the Wizard<br> 
                        If I make good<br> 
                        So I'll make good<br> 
                        <br> 
                        When I meet thе Wizard<br> 
                        Once I prove my worth<br> 
                        And then I meet thе Wizard<br> 
                        What I've waited for since, well, since birth<br> 
                        And with all his Wizard wisdom<br> 
                        By my looks, he won't be blinded<br> 
                        Do you think the Wizard is dumb?<br> 
                        Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded? No!<br> 
                        He'll say to me: I see who you truly are<br> 
                        A girl on whom I can rely<br> 
                        And that's how we'll begin<br> 
                        The Wizard and I<br> 
                        <br> 
                        Once I'm with the Wizard<br> 
                        My whole life will change<br> 
                        'Cause once you're with the Wizard<br> 
                        No one thinks you're strange<br> 
                        No father is not proud of you<br> 
                        No sister acts ashamed<br> 
                        And all of Oz has to love you<br> 
                        When, by the Wizard, you're acclaimed<br> 
                        And this gift or this curse I have inside<br> 
                        Maybe, at last, I'll know why<br> 
                        As we work hand in hand<br> 
                        The Wizard and I<br> 
                        And one day, he'll say to me, "Elphaba<br> 
                        A girl who is so superior<br> 
                        Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside<br> 
                        Have a matching exterior?<br> 
                        And since folks here to an absurd degree<br> 
                        Seem fixated on your verdigris<br> 
                        Would it be alright by you<br> 
                        If I de-greenify you?<br> 
                        And though, of course, that's not important to me<br> 
                        Alright, why not?, I'll reply<br> 
                        Oh, what a pair we'll be<br> 
                        The Wizard and I<br> 
                        Yes, what a pair we'll be<br> 
                        The Wizard and—<br> 
                        <br> 
                        Unlimited<br> 
                        My future is unlimited<br> 
                        And I've just had a vision, almost like a prophecy<br> 
                        I know it sounds truly crazy<br> 
                        And true, the vision's hazy<br> 
                        But I swear, someday, there'll be<br> 
                        A celebration throughout Oz<br> 
                        That's all to do with me<br> 
                        <br> 
                        And I'll stand there with the Wizard<br> 
                        Feeling the things I've never felt<br> 
                        And though I'd never show it<br> 
                        I'd be so happy I could melt<br> 
                        And so it will be for the rest of my life<br> 
                        And I'll want nothing else 'til I die<br> 
                        Held in such high esteem<br> 
                        When people see me, they will scream<br> 
                        For half of Oz's favorite team<br> 
                        The Wizard and I</p>

                    <p>Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle<br> 
                        My dear father<br> 
                        <br> 
                        There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz<br> 
                        But of course, I'll care for Nessa<br> 
                        But of course, I'll rise above it<br> 
                        For I know that's how you'd want me to respond<br> 
                        Yes<br> 
                        <br> 
                        There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is<br> 
                        Unusually and exceedingly peculiar<br> 
                        And altogether quite impossible to describe<br> 
                        Blonde<br> 
                        <br> 
                        What is this feeling, so sudden and new?<br> 
                        I felt the moment I laid eyes on you<br> 
                        My pulse is rushing<br> 
                        My head is reeling<br> 
                        Yeah, well, my face is flushing<br> 
                        What is this feeling<br> 
                        <br> 
                        Fervid as a flame?<br> 
                        Does it have a name?<br> 
                        Yes<br>

                        Your clothing<br> 
                        Let's just say<br> 
                        I loathe it all<br> 
                        <br> 
                        Every little trait, however small<br> 
                        Makes my very flesh begin to crawl<br> 
                        With simple, utter loathing<br> 
                        There's a strange exhilaration<br> 
                        In such total detestation<br> 
                        It's so pure, so strong<br> 
                        <br> 
                        Though I do admit, it came on fast<br> 
                        Still, I do believe that it can last<br> 
                        And I will be loathing<br>

                        She's a terror, she's a tartar, we don't mean to show a bias<br> 
                        But, Galinda, you're a martyr<br> 
                        Well, these things are sent to try us<br>

                        Oh, what is this feeling?<br>

                        (Every little trait, however small)<br>

                        I've heard of an Ox<br>
                        A professor from Quox<br>
                        No longer permitted to teach<br>
                        Who has lost all powers of speech<br>
                        And an owl in Munchkin Rock<br>
                        A vicar with a thriving flock<br>
                        Forbidden to preach<br>
                        Now he only can screech<br>
                        Only rumors, but still<br>
                        Enough to give pause<br>
                        To anyone with paws<br>
                        Something bad is happening in Oz<br>
                        Something bad? Happening in Oz?<br>
                        Under the surface<br>
                        Behind the scenes<br>
                        Something bad<br>
                        Sorry, "bad"<br>
                        Doctor Dillamond, if something bad is happening to the animals<br>
                        Someone's got to tell the Wizard<br>
                        That's why we have a Wizard<br>
                        So nothing bad<br>
                        I hope you're right<br>
                        Nothing all that bad<br>
                        Nothing truly bad<br>
                        Sorry, "bad"<br>
                        It couldn't happen here<br>

                        I see that, once again, the responsibility to corrupt my fellow students falls to me<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO]<br>
                        The trouble with schools is they always try to teach the wrong lesson<br>
                        Believe me, I've been kicked out of enough of them to know<br>
                        They want you to become less callow, less shallow<br>
                        But I say, why invite stress in?<br>
                        Stop studying strife<br>
                        And learn to live the unexamined life<br>
                        Dancing through life, skimming the surface<br>
                        Gliding where turf is smooth<br>
                        Life's more painless for the brainless<br>
                        Why think too hard when it's so soothing?<br>
                        Dancing through life, no need to tough it<br>
                        When you can slough it off as I do<br>
                        Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters<br>
                        It's just life, so keep dancing through<br>
                        Dancing through life, swaying and sweeping<br>
                        And always keeping cool<br>
                        Life is fraughtless when you're thoughtless<br>
                        Those who don't try never look foolish<br>
                        Dancing through life, mindless and careless<br>
                        Make sure you're where less trouble is rife<br>
                        Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing<br>
                        When you're dancing through life<br>
                        Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom<br>
                        We'll meet there later tonight<br>
                        We can dance till it's light<br>
                        Find the prettiest girl, give her a whirl<br>
                        Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom<br>
                        Come on, follow me<br>
                        You'll be happy to be there<br>

                        [FIYERO]<br>
                        If only because dust is what we come to<br>
                        <br>
                        [ALL]<br>
                        Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO, ALL]<br>
                        It's just life (Ah, ah)<br>
                        It's just life<br>
                        So keep dancing through<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        Galinda<br>
                        Um, I'll hope you'll save a dance for me tonight<br>
                        I'll be right there, waiting all night<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA, spoken]<br>
                        That's so kind<br>
                        But you know what would be even kinder?<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA]<br>
                        See that tragically beautiful girl?<br>
                        The one in the chair<br>
                        It seems so unfair<br>
                        We should go on a spree<br>
                        And not she, gee!<br>
                        I know someone would be my hero<br>
                        If that someone were<br>
                        To go invite her<br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        Well<br>
                        Maybe I could invite her<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA, spoken]<br>
                        Oh, Biq, really?<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA]<br>
                        You would do that for me?<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        I would do anything for you<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO, spoken]<br>
                        You're good!<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA, spoken]<br>
                        I don't know what you mean<br>
                        I love helping others<br>
                        Oh, and I happen to be free tonight, after all<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA]<br>
                        Now that we've met one another<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO & GALINDA]<br>
                        It's clear we deserve each other<br>
                        [GALINDA]<br>
                        You're perfect<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO]<br>
                        You're perfect<br>
                        <br>
                        [FIYERO & GALINDA]<br>
                        So we're perfect together<br>
                        Born to be forever<br>
                        Dancing through life<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        You'll never guess what just happened to me<br>
                        That perfectly adorable Munchkin boy just asked me out<br>
                        He said he was too shy to ask me out first, but then, Galinda emboldened him<br>
                        <br>
                        [ELPHABA, spoken]<br>
                        Wait, Galinda?<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        Don't<br>
                        Don't you dare say another word against her<br>
                        I'm about to have the happiest night of my life<br>
                        Thanks to Galinda<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE]<br>
                        Finally, for this one night<br>
                        I'm about to have a fun night<br>
                        With this Munchkin boy Galinda found for me<br>
                        And I only wish there were<br>
                        Something I could do for her<br>
                        To repay her<br>
                        Elphaba, see?<br>
                        We deserve each other<br>
                        And Galinda helped it come true<br>
                        We deserve each other, me and Boq<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        Please, Elphaba, try to understand<br>
                        <br>
                        [ELPHABA]<br>
                        I do<br>
                        <br>
                        [ELPHABA, spoken]<br>
                        Galinda, um<br>
                        Nessa and I were talking about you just now and—<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA, spoken]<br>
                        Oh, well, we were just talking about you<br>
                        How you should join us tonight at the Ozdust<br>
                        And don't tell me you have nothing to wear<br>
                        'Cause you could wear this<br>
                        I mean, it goes with everything you own<br>
                        <br>
                        [GALINDA]<br>
                        It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?<br>
                        You know black is this year's pink<br>
                        You deserve each other<br>
                        This hat and you, you're both so smart<br>
                        You deserve each other<br>
                        So here, out of the goodness of my heart<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ]<br>
                        Listen, Nessa?<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        Yes?<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ]<br>
                        Uh, Nessa<br>
                        I've got something to confess a<br>
                        Reason why, well<br>
                        Why I asked you here tonight<br>
                        And I know it isn't fair<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        Boq, I know why<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        You do?<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE]<br>
                        It's because I'm in this chair<br>
                        And you felt sorry for me<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE, spoken]<br>
                        Well, isn't that right?<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        No! No, no, no, I don't feel sorry for you<br>
                        You're great<br>
                        I asked you because<br>
                        Because<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ]<br>
                        Because you are so beautiful<br>
                        <br>
                        [NESSAROSE]<br>
                        Boq, I think you're wonderful<br>
                        And we deserve each other<br>
                        Don't you see this is our chance?<br>
                        We deserve each other<br>
                        Don't we, Boq?<br>
                        <br>
                        [BOQ, spoken]<br>
                        You know what?<br>
                        Let's dance<br>
                        <br>

                        Dancing through life here at the Ozdust<br>
                        If only because dust is what we come to<br>

                        Elphie, now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project<br>
                        <br>
                        [Elphaba]<br>
                        Oh, you really don't have to do that<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        I know!<br>
                        That's what makes me so nice<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I<br>
                        And let's face it, right? Who isn't less fortunate than I?<br>
                        My tender heart tends to start to bleed<br>
                        And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over<br>
                        I know, I know exactly what they need<br>
                        And even in your case<br>
                        Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face<br>
                        Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed<br>
                        Follow my lead<br>
                        And yes, indeed<br>
                        You will be, ah<br>
                        <br>
                        Popular<br>
                        You're gonna be popular<br>
                        I'll teach you the proper ploys when you talk to boys<br>
                        Little ways to flirt and flounce, ooh<br>
                        I'll show you what shoes to wear, how to fix your hair<br>
                        Everything that really counts to be<br>
                        <br>
                        Popular<br>
                        I'll help you be popular<br>
                        You'll hang with the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports<br>
                        Know the slang you've got to know<br>
                        So let's start 'cause you've got an awfully long way to go<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't be offended by my frank analysis<br>
                        Think of it as personality dialysis<br>
                        Now that I've chosen to become a pal<br>
                        A sister and adviser, there's nobody wiser<br>
                        Not when it comes to<br>
                        <br>
                        Popular<br>
                        I know about popular<br>
                        And with an assist from me to be who you'll be<br>
                        Instead of dreary who-you-were<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        Well, are!<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        There's nothing that can stop you from becoming populer, 'lar<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        La-la, la-la<br>
                        We're gonna make you popular<br>
                        When I see depressing creatures<br>
                        With unprepossessing features<br>
                        I remind them on their own behalf to think of<br>
                        Celebrated heads of state<br>
                        Or especially great communicators<br>
                        Did they have brains or knowledge?<br>
                        Don't make me laugh<br>
                        <br>
                        They were<br>

                        Popular<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        Right!<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        It's all about popular<br>
                        It's not about aptitude, it's the way you're viewed<br>
                        So it's very shrewd to be<br>
                        Very, very popular like me, me<br>
                        <br>
                        And though you protest<br>
                        Your disinterest<br>
                        I know clandestinely<br>
                        You're gonna grin and bear it, your newfound popularity (woo!)<br>
                        <br>
                        La-la, la-la<br>
                        La-la, la-la<br>
                        La-la, ooh<br>
                        <br>
                        You'll be popular<br>
                        Just not as quite as popular as me</p>

                        Hands touch, eyes meet<br>
                        Sudden silence, sudden heat<br>
                        Hearts leap in a giddy whirl<br>
                        He could be that boy, but I'm not that girl<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't dream too far<br>
                        Don't lose sight of who you are<br>
                        Don't remember that rush of joy<br>
                        He could be that boy<br>

                        But that doesn't soften the ache we feel<br>
                        When reality sets back in<br>
                        <br>
                        Blithe smile, lithe limb<br>
                        She who's winsome, she wins him<br>
                        Gold hair with a gentle curl<br>
                        That's the girl hе chose<br>
                        And Heaven knows<br>
                        I'm not that girl<br>
                        <br>
                        Don't wish, don't start<br>
                        Wishing only wounds thе heart<br>
                        I wasn't born for the rose and pearl<br>
                        There's a girl I know<br>

                        Just say you're sorry<br>
                        You can still be with the wizard<br>
                        What you've worked and waited for<br>
                        You can have all you ever wanted<br>

                        No<br>
                        I can't want it anymore<br>
                        <br>
                        Something has changed within me<br>
                        Something is not the same<br>
                        I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game<br>
                        Too late for second-guessing<br>
                        Too late to go back to sleep<br>
                        It's time to trust my instincts<br>
                        Close my eyes and leap<br>
                        <br>
                        It's time to try defying gravity<br>
                        I think I'll try defying gravity<br>
                        And you can't pull me down<br>

                        Can't I make you understand<br>
                        You're having delusions of grandeur?<br>

                        'Cause someone says they're so<br>
                        Some things I cannot change<br>
                        But till I try, I'll never know<br>
                        Too long I've been afraid of<br>
                        Losing love, I guess I've lost<br>
                        Well, if that's love<br>
                        It comes at much too high a cost<br>
                        <br>
                        I'd sooner buy defying gravity<br>
                        Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity<br>
                        And you can't pull me down<br>

                        <br>
                        So if you care to find me, look to the western sky<br>
                        As someone told me lately<br>
                        Everyone deserves the chance to fly<br>
                        And if I'm flying solo<br>
                        At least I'm flying free<br>
                        To those who'd ground me<br>
                        Take a message back from me<br>
                        <br>
                        Tell them how I am defying gravity<br>
                        I'm flying high, defying gravity<br>
                        And soon I'll match them in renown<br>
                        <br>
                        Unlimited<br>
                        Unlimited<br>
                        Unlimited, oh<br>
                        <br>
                        And nobody in all of Oz<br>
                        No wizard that there is or was<br>
                        Is ever gonna bring me down<br>
                        <br>
                        [Glinda]<br>
                        I hope you're happy<br>
                        <br>
                        [Citizens of Oz and Elphaba]<br>
                        Look at her, she's wicked, get her!<br>
                        (Bring me down) no one mourns the wicked<br>
                        So we've got to bring her<br>
                        (Oh) down<br>
                        Down, woah</p>
